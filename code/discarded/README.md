# Verilog directory

This directory contains partial implementations and experimental code that were ultimately not included in the master's thesis. This content is mostly related to MITM attacks against communication with the AT93C66A EEPROM. While these files were discarded from the final work, they are preserved here in case they prove useful in the future.
